This game folder only contains games with viable code for integration and testing,
for a bigger archive of all games that are compatible with Q3 content, see
https://github.com/briancullinan/planet_quake_game

The reason for making a copy like this is basically just being able to search 
the code for clues. These are to most complete total conversion mods. For example,
smokinguns is a completely different game, and although Military Forces is cool,
it's incomplete, so it's in the other repo.
