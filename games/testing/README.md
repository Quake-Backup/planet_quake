This is a mod that is sym-linked to for testing different features:

roycovideo.pk3dir - Used for testing video formats and features, also replaced
q3dm0 banner with intro.RoQ as a proof of concept for shader replacements
and also so the player can change rooms and see/hear the video continues to play
even if no one is around to listen (behind the scenes it counts and seeks but 
doesn't continue to hit the hard drive unless someone is watching).

teleporter-mod - contains a full build, proof-of-concept, when a player walks 
into a teleporter it opens a URL in a web browser.

baseq3-menu - contains the minimum necessary file to run the menu system.
