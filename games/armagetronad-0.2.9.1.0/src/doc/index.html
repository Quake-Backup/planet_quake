<a name=><h3 align=left>WARNING: (READ IT! it's NOT legalese, I mean it!)</h3></a>

<p align=justify>
Some people react on flashing lights in a very unpleasant manner:
they experience epileptic seizures. Even if you did never have such
a seizure, you may still be affected by those induced seizures. 
Since Armagetron Advanced contains rhythmic flashing lights (the grid you race
over...), there is a higher risk of induced seizures than in normal
computer games. FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, do NOT play Armagetron Advanced on a wide TV
screen or in a dark room and always keep a good eye distance to
your monitor. WE DO NOT FEEL RESPONSIBLE for anything that might happen
to you while playing Armagetron Advanced, even if you do respect these advises
(See legal stuff below). 
</p>

<a name=><h3 align=left>How to play</h3></a>

<p align=justify>
The rules are simple: you ride a lightcycle, a kind of motorbike that
can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be
stopped. Avoid running into a wall while trying to make your opponent run into a wall.
Just in case you do not know: this idea is best known from the Disney
movie "Tron" from 1982. However, that's not the origin of the game idea:
The earliest arcade game of that type was 
<a href="http://www.klov.com/B/Blockade.html" target=_top><strong>Blockade</strong></a> from 1976, the first known home versions
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snafu_%28video_game%29" target=_top><strong>SNAFU</strong></a> on the Intellivision from 1981 and
<a href="http://www.atarihq.com/reviews/2600/surround.html" target=_top><strong>Surround</strong></a> for the Atari 2600.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Acceleration is possible by driving close to player walls, be it your own wall or the
wall of your enemy. Every time you make a turn, you lose a little bit of your speed, so don't be 
too nervous; speed is your only resource against other players!
</p>

<a name=><h3 align=left>Quick start</h3></a>
<p align=justify>
First, you'll be confronted with the selection of your favourite language. 
Use CURSOR UP/DOWN to select, then ENTER/RETURN to accept. Next, there is a quick
and simplified setup screen. use CURSOR UP/DOWN to navigate the entries, CURSOR LEFT/RIGHT
to make changes to selection items and use standard editing controls to change your name.
If you're happy with the choices, press ENTER on any of the two 'Accept' menu items.
You will be tossed into a training match against a single AI opponent with reduced speed
where you can learn the keybindings.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Reading this, you probably already went through those steps. You can repeat the simplified
setup in the menu "System Setup"/"Misc Stuff"/"Redo First Setup" and pick different languages
in "System Setup"/"Misc Stuff"/"Language Settings".</p>

<a name=><h3 align=left>Additional keyboard layout</h3></a>

<p align=justify>
<table>
<tr><td>show scores            </td><td>: TAB</td></tr>
<tr><td>scroll message console </td><td>: page up/down</td></tr>
<tr><td>toggle fullscreen	   </td><td>: n</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td width = 200 >pauses/unpauses the game</td><td>: p</td></tr> 
<tr><td>quit to the game menu</td><td>: q/ESC</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p align=justify>
SHIFT-ESC is the "boss key" and quits Armagetron Advanced as fast as possible.
</p>

<a name=><h4 align=left>Menu navigation:</h4></a>

<p align=justify>
<table>
<tr><td>Move up one item</td><td>cursor up</td></tr>
<tr><td>Move down one item</td><td>cursor down</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change item</td><td>cursor left/right</td></tr>
<tr><td width = 200>Enter Submenu/Activate item</td><td>return/enter/space</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leave Menu</td><td>ESC</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<a name=><h4 align=left>change controls (in "Player Menu"/"Player x"/"(Camera) Input Configuration" and "System Setup"/"Misc Stuff"/"Global Keyboard Configuration"):</h4></a>

<p align=justify>
Press <strong>enter</strong> or <strong>space</strong> on the control you wish to change, then press
the key/mousebutton you want to assign to that control. Moving the
mouse also works. 
<br>
Press <strong>delete</strong> or <strong>backspace</strong> to reset the control binds for the selected
functions.
</p>

<p align=justify>
After your first matches, you should  go into the "Player Menu", set your name,
your keyboard and mouse configuration. Then, get some friends together and try
the multiplayer modes!
