    Guard key repeat data with a second, local, flag
    
    This makes sure it does not get used uninitialized, the previous
    guard flag was global.

    Handle negative CONSOLE_COLUMNS, too

commit 34f42ae4b776bb29d23e2a057ca7b467d4d7822e
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Fri Sep 11 18:12:32 2020 +0200

    Use semi-sensible fallback on CONSOLE_COLUMNS 0
    
    If the user switches between 0.2.8.3 and 0.2.9.X, problems
    arise because 0.2.9 sets the new default of
    CONSOLE_COLUMNS to 0, signifying pixel by pixel font rendering
    there. Here, we just fallback to the default 78 columns.

commit 84781a403cb920c26d0799113cc949937cd95285
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Wed Sep 9 21:37:07 2020 +0200

    Adapt SDL build
    
    Take over some debian build settings for SDL
    the usual goals: more compatibility while keeping file size small
    
    Add libraries to armabuild for sound compatibility
    
    Enable shared (dynamic runtime) linkage in SDL
    with X11, alsa and pulseaudio
    
    pulseaudio in particular pulls in FLAC and ogg as dependencies, blowing
    up our appimages. By having SDL load them on demand at runtime, we no
    longer have them as hard dependencies.
    If none of SDL, alsa or pulse are present on the user's system, they don't
    get sound, but they still can play.

Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Sat Aug 29 23:37:54 2020 +0200

    Only advance SAVED_IN_VERSION
    
    Rationale: If we allow the version to go back and forth,
    adaptions to new versions may be done multiple times, for
    example overriding explicit user choice to stay at old
    default values.

    Add tConfigMigration to adapt user configuration to new defaults
    
    Implements https://gitlab.com/armagetronad/armagetronad/-/issues/61
    Callbacks can be registered with static tConfigMigration objects,
    the constructor takes a function object that gets executed
    if the configuration is loaded from a different version than
    it was saved in.

    Merge: Console and small font improvements
    
    Still related to https://gitlab.com/armagetronad/armagetronad/-/merge_requests/79
    
    By default, don't let the console show more than 47 rows
    (Value arbitrarily picked so Z-Man just about gets his desired font style)
    Can be overridden with CONSOLE_COLUMNS -1, or of course some large value.

    CONSOLE_COLUMNS 0 means automatic mode
    
    It tries to pick the console font scale so that the big font
    is shown mostly pixel intact (slightly offset to give a little
    hint at antialiasing).
    It's the new default for new users. The old fixed 78 columms
    can get ridiculously big.

    Add HUD_MAX_WIDTH
    
    Limits the width of the HUD relative to the screen height, useful
    for ultrawide screens, and gives it the correct aspect ratio back.
    The default is 1.33333, limiting the width to what it would be on
    a 4:3 screen.
    
    The legacy value for old players is 0, which is the
    non-aspect-ratio-preserving stretching over the whole screen width.
    
    Fixes more of https://gitlab.com/armagetronad/armagetronad/-/issues/59
    Yes, the original plan was to not fix this on 0.2.9, but the groundwork
    was already done by the splitscreen implementation. And precisely
    this setting is going to be useful on 0.4.

    Second: Steam
    Third: Zero Install and download page
    Fourth: PPA
    
    Rationale:
    The first wave can be safely rerun and does not directly affect users.
    
    The first and second wave deployments depend on external
    services and may fail without fault on our part, and if that happens,
    we can only wait and retry.
    
    The third wave only interacts with services under our full control, so
    if they fail, we can fix the problems and try again.
    
    The fourth wave is fire and forget, we don't get to react to errors anyway,
    but reruns cause mail spam.

    Merge: More lenient playback
    
    See merge request armagetronad/armagetronad!73
    
    Implements https://gitlab.com/armagetronad/armagetronad/-/issues/56

commit d313bc4e5e811925513bf34ceda72b1f4fea4c57
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Tue Aug 11 00:24:18 2020 +0200

    Consider clientside playbacks desynced on version mismatch
    
    If, on playback on the client, the recorded version differs from
    the current version, consider the playback desynced. It has a high
    chance of breaking anyway.

commit 6bceaa191b3140b6d911e7310f17a1d2b27da519
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Tue Aug 11 00:12:05 2020 +0200

    Implement lenient playback mode
    
    If we find we desynced anyway, ignore other problems as well and
    try to move over them:
    Ping estimates are always 1 ms
    Ping variance is always 0 ms
    Timer sync ignores long delays
    network sync ignores outstanding acks

Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Tue Aug 11 00:09:26 2020 +0200

    Add nWaitForAck::DesyncedPlayback()
    
    This static function returns true if we're sure we desynced
    a clientside playback and can enter a more lenient mode where
    we no longer try to follow the original client's execution
    exactly.

    Allow skipping of unexpected blocks on playback

commit 6afd9bf6bfcac90cf61c69cce5fe61680a9d3233
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Sun Aug 9 18:30:35 2020 +0200

    Add EXPECT_ACK_ON_CLIENT_PLAYBACK, default to 0
    
    At the default setting, on playback, missing Acks from a server
    are ignored and do not lead to disconnections. It's possible the
    playback can recover.
    
    Of course, the default makes debugging actual netcode problems
    impossible; for that, put it to 1 while recording.

    Tooltip tweaks: no spectator toggle, activate chat
    
    Nobody needs to know about the spectator toggle, and prompting
    the player to press it and deduce what it does (it's not immediate)
    is probably counterproductive.
    Chat, however, should be in. Fell out by accident.

    Rename old silence_player_* strings to ignore_player_*
    
    Resolves https://gitlab.com/armagetronad/armagetronad/-/issues/22
    (Two different strings with the same name)
    
    Differently than planned. The idea was to rename the new
    entry for vote items, but the 'ignore' name is much more
    fitting for the old IDs.

    Renew git checkout cache every run
    
    Git checkouts are cached between jobs. Different jobs can
    belong to different branches, causing odd build failures if
    the cache does not fit the branch. So make sure that if we need
    the external git checkouts, that they are refreshed.

    A bit silly. If the version changes, the tarball filename changes

    Merge: Better builds by splitting them into multiple jobs
    
    It's more setup work because dependencies and artifacts need managing, but not too much.
    
    Reward: Builds of different commits can better run in parallel and don't have to wait for the one dangling job (the Windows build) of the previous build to wrap up. Also, using shared runners, all build jobs can run at once and yield errors faster and with clearer logs.

    Reorder jobs so build_server_32 comes last
    
    Don't know if it has any effect. But build_server_32 is just a pack-up
    job after the real build in build_server_32, maybe this will make it
    get scheduled last when the other jobs are done and only slow
    windows is chugging along.

    Replace exit() by _exit() after unsuccessful script launch
    
    According to 'man 2 exit', _exit() does the same thing as exit(),
    only that it does not call any registered on_exit functions.
    C++ uses that mechanism to register its static object shutdown
    handlers and we want to quit silently without side effects,
    so this is precisely the right thing.

    Apply steam title image
    
    Copy it over from the steam-art package
    Adapt the game sources to use it (would technically
    not be required, the image loaders understand the alternative
    image is a png, not a jpg, but it would be a bit iffy
    to exploit that IMHO)

    Replace multipart command line with script
    
    Another disadvantage of building in 'docker run', only one command is
    supported.

    Do the actual work in 'docker run', not 'build'
    
    While it makes handling the container ID more complicated, it seems
    to make more sense and makes error handling easier. Plus, the 'run'
    environment is more flexible and may allow us more tricks in the
    future.

    Remove DATE_R
    
    We always use either SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH as date source or the
    current date. Before the reproducibility patch, we would prefer
    to use the last change of the source file, which requires
    the -r flag, which we therefore tested for. Still supporting
    that now would require too much if/else logic.

    needs to be passed through. Automake does not like that. Lucily,

    Check that a client is allowed to send netobjects before changing any state
    
    Add a static AcceptClientSyncStatic() method to nNetObject classes to
    report that permission to the system before any objects need to be created.
    
    Previously, that was the sole responsibility of the virtual AcceptClientSync(),
    which required that we allow the object the client sends to be created, which
    already can cause damage. Furthermore, the cleanup in the case where creation
    should not be allowed was faulty and crashed.

    Better: use nObserverPtr to check for deletion of no
    
    This avoids the trouble the previous commit would have caused
    if no gets destroyed, but an entirely new object gets created in its
    place.
    I'd use nObserverPtr for the current object no itself, but
    nObserverPtr only is for const pointers.

    Replace reference holding smart pointer with checks.
    
    The reference counting smart pointer here had side effects; it
    destroyed the main game timer when a second player connects (fixed
    in the last commit) and caused duplicate death sync messages for cycles
    (not separately fixed).
    So now, instead of holding a reference, we check whether the object
    still exists after calling unknown code.

    contrary to what I believed earlier, the 'Expired Vote' text

    change 'Expired Vote' to "original text (Already resolved)"
    and make it translatable.

    Reset persistent spam data when a machine is banned.
    
    Fixes the issue of a client returning after a ban for chat spam and receiving a new longer ban for sending one chat message (bug #1269909).

Date:   Sun Jan 12 12:08:21 2014 -0500

    Added ACCESS_LEVEL_ANNOUNCE_LOGIN setting that determines if a player's login/logout message can be announced. This can help cut down on authentication-spam for tournaments. Example:
    
        # Only users who are Team Leader or more privileged get their login/logout announced.

    Better logic for determining which past chat comes from disconnected
    players. Not fooled by lingering active players any more (unless they
    spam as well, which should be easy to detect).

commit 2aa1ccdfcae5665187eb03bd6ecb81ff6d237a0e
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Sat Nov 23 19:06:10 2013 +0100

    Players with anything better than default remote authentication now
    get a short list of past players and their goodbye chat. Including IP
    addresses if authorized. Information is polled from the nMachine list.
    Small flaw: list will not contain drive by spam from players that
    still have one active login.

    Fix NULL check in nLoginProcess::ProcessClientAnswer. This was audited by Z-Man, and it is not exploitable.
    
    There is a NULL check on the client socket done in rec_peer(), which is part of the call chain to handle the message (rec_peer → nDescriptor::HandleMessage → nAuthentication::HandlePasswordAnswer → nLoginProcess::ProcessClientAnswer).

    Erm, forget the offset. Stupid idea. The revisions would drift anyway.
    New plan: let svn revno version tags follow bzr by peeking at the bzr-svn sync information.

commit c8ad5917bb0536a18965e0da56806e9f89336312
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>

    Applying offset to version revno generation so bzr revnos match svn revnos.

Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Mon Sep 19 16:10:54 2011 +0200

    Now that we upgraded to 0.2.9, we can switch from date tags to
    revision numbers. Still not as good as the revision count we're using
    on trunk, but since this branch is going to be synced with SVN for its
    entire lifetime, revnos are guaranteed to be monononeously increasing
    on the mainline.

    Better timer sync averaging:
    - Processing syncs is now delayed to the next frame when an upper
      bound on the receive time is known
    - Averaging now is careful not to weight obviously delayed sync
      packets too much. Side effect: the timer errs on the side of high
      ping compensation and runs a few ms early, avoiding lag slides.
    - New (only documented in settings.cfg) configuration of that system.
    - The old round start fudge factor is out.

Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Thu Sep 9 00:56:15 2010 +0200

    Fixing backwards simulation problems in three independent places:
    - the bug in eGameObject::TimestepThis that caused one extra (often
      backward) simulation step after handling events is fixed
    - gCycleMovement::Timestep() uses the regular path for negative timesteps,
      which does nothing unless turns are pending
    - gCycleMovemen::TimestepCore() refuses to move back further than the
      last turn.

    Improved server behaviour during fullscreen message display. Before,
    it would wait for the clients to finish directly; that caused trouble,
    because the message usually is triggered by a network message from a
    remote admin, which means the server is in packet receiving state and
    it should quit from that state ASAP to avoid side effects. Now, the
    waiting is done in a background task stated via the st_Todo mechanism.

    for remote admins.

Date:   Sun Feb 15 23:36:08 2009 +0100

    Instead of clearing the registration pointer of nNetObjects once
    they're remotely destroyed, have them switch over to being considered
    created locally. Objects lingering on for some reason still hold on
    to their object ID; if it gets reassigned on the server to some other
    object before the original object finally gets destroyed, clients
    rightfully complain about a duplicate use of the ID. Keeping the
    object registered avoids the reuse of the ID.

    Stop responding to pings when TALK_TO_MASTER was never set and no LAN
    broadcast server discovery queries came in. This should get servers
    off the master list if you turn TALK_TO_MASTER to 0 and restart the
    server. They'll linger on a bit on some users' lists, especially if
    the server is on a LAN and queried from the LAN a lot, though.

    to avoid confusion by too many recolorings.

    TEAM_ELIMINATION_MODE defines the way ArmagetronAd should eliminate teams when there's more teams than TEAMS_MAX: Set to 0 it will try to keep as many players as possible, kicking teams that have the lowest score if teams are balanced; Set to 1 it will try to keep the best team colors (Team blue, then Team gold, then Team red, etc); Set to 2 it will kick out the teams that have the lowest score, regardless of balance. Copy-paste ftw.

    Serval changes:
    * se_SecretConsoleOut is now _way_ more polyvalent
    * Forcing an UpdateName() upon auth
    * Admin commands are now logged with username(or (G)?ID, if the user is logged in), and are showed to everyone in the server who have an access level better than ACCESS_LEVEL_SPY_CONSOLE

    Put the code to log score differences and the code to update the suspend count into separate functions. Needed for the sty+ct branch and I guess it's a good idea to minimize confusing function names :-)

    made use of the new 0xRESETT tColorStringProxies. Also removed a lot of tabs that made the code unreadable at tabstop=4 (unfortunately we settled to use spaces for indentation, I agree that using tabs at the beginning of lines would have been way better)

    Implemented wrtl's suggestion for color code penalty to spam.
    To compensate a bit, the default spam settings are now a abit nicer, and
    there are at least three warnings (configurable) before you get kicked by spam.

    /rtfm now respects serverside silencing and the spam protection, plus there's an announcement to everyone if someone uses it (but only the sender and receiver get spammed with the complete help text, of course). I don't really understand the code to make a message silencable by the client, though :-(

    MIN_VOTERS now correctly applied to votes that not everyone can technically vote on. The messages are still a bit strange (first, it looks as if the vote got accepted as a valid vote), but we'll have to live with that (or duplicate some code).

    Fixed team menu bugs: "Join any/create new" is now always there when it makes sense, and team properties get updated on the client when players switch teams, so there will be no more spurious "Join x" messages on non-team servers.

    Added eGameObject::OnRoundBegin(), called after game object creation.
    Used it in the zone code to fix the flickering empty zone glitch in sumo,
    and to avoid rare midgame zone ownership changes.

    Strings get excess zeroes clamped away before they are written over the net. This fixes sporadic network message length discrepancies on playback. I hope the extra zeroes don't do harm elsewhere (string comparison is safe).

    Restored behavior that kick votes over the chat interface don't get transformed to removal votes.

commit 29206d3a6bc4dc94de803f86ae7837b4fad2c3e6
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Thu Mar 6 01:14:17 2008 +0100

    All votes are now handled over the new server controlled system
    internally. For old clients (pre 0.2.8), the vote items disguise as
    kick votes (if they are kick or suspend votes) and are plainly
    invisible for include and command votes.
    The decision to transform a kick into a suspension is now made on vote
    creation time.

    If the team owning a zone is dead at round end, the zone does not collapse harmlessly; instead, it gets "touchy" and will collapse at the slightest contact with an enemy.

    Shuffled around access levels. Authenticated now is all on the bottom, only barely above "Program". Default access level for remote users stays 15, only that it's now named "Remote User".

    Added two access levels below authenticated that you can USER_LEVEL players to; intended to be used to take away rights authenticated players usually get (like, starting votes) for selected users.

    Avoiding redundant wall coordinates during holing. This makes the holer information a bit inaccurate; if someone "enlarges" a reviously existing hole, it will belong entirely to him, and not just the new bits.
    Duplicating last wall coordinate on Update() if there was a hole up to the wall end; this avoids "dragging" the hole along.

    Broke the unfortunate chain of events that leads to severe FPS drops on old clients on several links:
     - server no longer sends redundant cycle death sync messages.
     - client ignores redundant cycle death messages; they caused calls to eGameObject::Move on objects already removed from the activity list.
     - game objects removed from the active lists no longer have currentFace set
     - game objects removed from the list, when they move, just update their position and don't get a new currentFace.
    The root of the problem are inactive game objects that still have a currentFace set. That causes that face and all its replacement in the
    grid reordering code to be marked as "not to be simplified".

    Static player walls now also get a display list.

    Server compatibility restored.

commit 8b846b0bca052e43f5496ad9765cb68f9dcb52cd
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 11 15:02:16 2008 +0100

    Added display list wrapper for convenient caching of renderings.
    Used it for the console and individual cycle walls.

Date:   Mon Feb 11 12:26:08 2008 +0100

    Hmm, odd rendering height bug for the rim walls. It seems the code renders them wrongly the first time around. Oh well, let's just create the display list some frames into the round :)

commit e06f0e5968c7094ce1c79e946ed55602c03764d9
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 11 11:50:13 2008 +0100

    Still more performance: putting all rim walls into one display list (as long as they are not lowered for rendering).

    Avoiding state changes when rendering rim walls (at least, when no moviepack is selected).

commit d6cfcfdce701cc1f4a26e0a2fb7485b603e90273
Author: Manuel Moos <z-man@users.sf.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 11 09:48:00 2008 +0100

    Performance improvement: the cycle now triggers rendering of its walls, the renderer does not have to traverse all walls (and render them multiple times).

Author: nemostultae <Unknown>
Date:   Sun Feb 10 07:26:33 2008 +0000

    * Fixed dedicated compilation by adding a "Copy Headers" build phase to every target with the correct config.h for that target. The file's role is set to Project so it doesn't actually get copied. The other solution attempts failed: tried putting the src/macosx/dedicated or src/macosx/client folder in the search path for each respective target, and header files aren't members of a target so we couldn't exclude them (annoying).
    * Enabled auth server support on server
    * Enabled ZThread support in both client and server

    eGameObject::DeleteAll no longer calls Kill(), only RemoveFromGame().
    Several spurious explosion generations in gCycle were removed.
    The desired effect: no more unwanted explosions, and a cleaner game exit at round end.
    Some arcane bits of ancient code were removed here, I hope without ill side effects.

Author: wrtlprnft <Unknown>
Date:   Sat Feb 9 14:26:59 2008 +0000

    Added a new flag that allows users to specify whether they want their identity to be hidden.
    Maybe the serverside handling of it can be improved a bit by allowing users (like administrators) to only hide their access level without hiding their ID.

    Dunno if this is a very good idea, but it saves you one keystroke:
    If there's one of those enter password dialogs and the name that's suggested by the server matches a global ID (from any player) the password field is selected, otherwise it's the username field. Useful if you don't want to trust your password to user.cfg but still comfortably log in.

     text input fields now let the text wrap correctly and make use of the space allocated for them in a not-completely-dumb way. And *sigh* depending on the text field, color codes are either ignored (for the usernames) or both displayed in text and rendered.
     "KICK 2pack" no longer kicks user 2 instead of player 2pack.
     all admin commands now also accept partial name matches, like /msg, and check for case sensitive matches in the screen name first, then the user name, then case insensitive matches in the two.
     Added authority black/whitelists.
     Debug recordings now work with authentication and are safe to share, no secret information is recorded.

    Better virtual RemoveFromGame logic for eGameObjects, derived classes now don't have to worry about things like removing themselves from the lists or clearing the current grid face (forgetting that has ugly effects).

    Aplied yet another GCC 4.3 patch, and this time, put all of the includes we keep forgetting into defs.h. They should be removed at a later time again.

Author: z-man <Unknown>
Date:   Tue Jan 29 18:18:27 2008 +0000

    Added PLAYER_RANDOM_COLOR to randomly pick a collor every round.
    The new pick gets rejected if it is closer to the other players' colors than the old color, so the thing stabilizes you to a unique color after a while.

Date:   Mon Jan 28 22:02:21 2008 +0000

    Hole score management is now done with an extra redirection: hole->explosion->cycle.
    hat way, in case a cycle can produce multiple explosions (not the case
    with respawning, there it is a new cycle every spawn), the player can
    get multiple scores for holes.

    • Only build for native architecture in dedicated “Debug” builds as well.
    • Remove package files build step from dedicated target
    • Pass in useful command-line arguments for dedicated target (--datadir, etc…)
    • Added “Create Client Release”, “Create Dedicated Release”, and “Create Full Release” targets. The disk images are placed in $BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR (build/Release usually).
    
    The “Create Client Release” target checks to see if you have an $AA_RECORDER_APP environment variable set, and if you do the recorder app will be included in the disk image. For example I have in my .bash_profile:
    
        AA_RECORDER_APP="/Users/Shared/Applications/Games/Armagetron Advanced Recorder.app"
    
    • Changed a few svn:ignore properties to ignore generated files
    • dmg-convert, dmg-create → added
    • Updated README-Subversion with new information about targets

Author: z-man <Unknown>
Date:   Thu Jan 10 01:43:13 2008 +0000

    Fixed memory leak caused by missing gParser destructor. The leakfinding
    memory manager missed it because all allocation was done through libxml2,
    and it passed casual code review because the corresponding delete operation
    did happen, just not always; a leak would occur every time a completely new
    game was started.

    Well, the new timer code did the same as the old one, so instead of activating it, the high resolution timer is now dropped in favor of the old low resolution timer (which is then smoothed) if the high resolution timer is making trouble.

    No longer accept fullscreen toggles when the application is active. It's a mystery how they get through, but they trigger a bug in SDL_GetAppState() that makes the application marked as inactive when it gets restored.

    Const-correctness for some virtual functions. They were const in gCycle, but not in eGameObject, causing the wrong instance to be called in eCamera, causing camera jumps whenever there was a lag slide.

    Client never claims it expires when it connects to the master server. Two of
    them are running from the trunk now, and any alpha from 0.2.8 would expire
    immediately. Oh well.

    - Remove double slashes from both the part where the map wants to be and the path it was loaded from before checking for equeality (fixes problem with an empty category attribute).
    - Don't kill the server/client if the map filepath is wrong and just display a tERR_WARN. A wrong map file path is NOT severe enough to kill a server full of players, ever.

    Got rid of quite a lot of raycasts by caching the result of the rubber raycast (from the cycle to the front) during a single simulation frame when nothing can jump into the cycle's path. The cycle position extrapolation code also uses the cached data.

Author: z-man <Unknown>
Date:   Thu Aug 3 21:56:32 2006 +0000

    Network code optimizations:
    - sn_Receive() no longer automatically calls the (moderately expensive) sn_SendPlanned()
      sending function, the caller has to take care of that when ready. The usual procedure would be
      sn_Receive(); nNetObject::SyncAll(); sn_SendPlanned();
      Adaptions to this all over the place are already done.
    - the game code calls the network code less often per frame, two calls were entirely wasted.
    - nNetObject::SyncAll() removes objects earlier from the syncing list so it is shorter and
      can be processed quicker the next time; the pruning is done outside of the client iterating loop
      so it doesn't get called needlessly often.

    - Moved all the defined classes into a new namespace to avoid possible future conflicts as the code doesn't use our normal naming convention.
    - Made the color blend factor and minimal size of the Lag-O-Meter configurable.
    - Added option to use the old Lag-O-Meter, this will disappear (#ifdef'd out actually) in the trunk.
    - Added menu option to render the axes indicator.

    Added StateUpdate() to stuff that is called right after network data is
    received. This should fix the short rounds at match end if a player scores
    at the last possible momemt when the round restart has already been decided,
    but not yet executed; that moment now no longer exists.

    Used new wall end position snapshots to make wall time extrapolation more accurate, especially while rubber is being used.
    Rubberless deaths replaced with instant rubber usage that lets the cycle survive if the trails are short compared to rubber, as is often the case on race type servers. Groundpig, this is for you :)

    Added the possibility to make "snapshots" of the current wall end data; it is stored in one of the coord_ entries and not touched on further updates. Hmm, this would also give a slightly better cycle position history with the right query functions.

    Drop wall on rubberless deaths; the current wall gets updated on death, and with the warped position, this could mean trouble. The actual position of the walls doesn't matter in the end, they get holed away some commands later.

    Factored position prediction code into own function, it's now called from gCycle::Timestep, no longer TimestepCore(), where it will always be called so the wall prediction is always active.

Date:   Sun Jul 16 07:56:31 2006 +0000

    Added prediction of walls on the dedicated server: wall ends can be set to the predicted position the cycle will be at at the time any other game object is simulated to. The other objects check for the presence of these extrapolated wall ends and can delay their simulation until the predicted wall turns real or disappears. This should get rid of most rubberless death bugs, let's hope it doesn't produce to many new ones.

    Improved rubber precision by predicting rubber usage for the reservoir mindistance.
    Smoothly blend from distance based turn commands (without rubber active) to time based turn commands (with full rubber active, when sitting directly in front of a wall).

    Umm, perhaps it would be nice not to use up credit for lag compensation if you're not actually going to compensate anything? (When rubber is active)

    Disabled lag compensation when rubber is active for now. It is making too many problems. The packet loss tolerance already takes care the player doesn't get killed from lag, that's better than nothing.

    Fixed AI balancing. AIs are, at the lowest level, always allowed to join a team now. The higher level balancing code is responsible for making sure the joining makes sense.

Author: z-man <Unknown>
Date:   Sun Jul 9 09:32:03 2006 +0000

    Fixed trail end related simulation accuracy bugs. The rubber code now checks when a trail end will disappear and will simulate exactly to that point. When stuck on a trail end, the moment you're allowed to pass it is thus better defined even when simulating with large timesteps.

    "Lag turn" bugfix. Sometimes, the server would initiate a cycle turn and mark the turn command as exectued, but the cycle was unable to execute the turn right away. The following inconsistent sync message confused the client.

    Added prototypes for lag compensation functions so they can be integrated in the Windows/Mac projects before they're actually used.
    Splitted libenginecore.a from libengine.a with the files that use most of the CPU time; they can be compiled with optimizations even if the rest of the code is in debug mode.

     Fixed a segfault that occured with custom axes and AIs.
     this is not an optimal solution, but it's better than a crash (the AIs might be more stupid than usual, but I didn't notice anything)

    Lag improvements: instead of just pausing, the game now uses the select() system call that pauses until a time has elapsed or network data has arrived. The data is then processed as fast as possible, answers are sent out, and the cycle restarts.

    Added a timeout to enemy contacs with fortress zones.
    If the timeout is set, all records and effects of the contact are deleted,
    the touching team won't get points if the zone collapses, and nobody of the
    owning team gets killed.
    Additionally, if the zone is a sumo zone (negative conquest decay rate),
    it will collapse harmlessly.

    The server waits for everyone to read the message if it went out to all clients.
    New console command: FULLSCREEN_MESSAGE <timeout> <message> triggers such a thing manually, and MESSAGE_OF_DAY is displayed that way, too, if possible, with configurable title (TITLE_OF_DAY) and timeout (MESSAGE_OF_DAY_TIMEOUT).

    Worked around the problem that you can't see a public server on your LAN in
    the Internet Server browser because its answer comes from the wrong IP: If
    an unknown server info comes in, its source IP is just added to the list of
    servers.
    Fixed bug that a server with SEVER_DNS set was not possible to connect to in
    the LAN browser.

    Whoops, logic error. Got the extra condition that allows you to kickvote at the start the wrong way round.

    Fixed "Team Red" bug. If, on a two team server, one team gets abandonned and another team gets created right away, it no longer gets a previously unused color, but the one that was just freed.

    Clients older than 0.2.8.2, when they go into the invisible spectator mode, still leave a spectator player lingering around until they either enter the game again or quit. This player can server as a kick vote target.

    Phasing fix: When A grinds B's current wall, B's last driving direction is taken to be opposite to the grid. When A turns to cut off B, that gives the algorithms better data, or so the hope is.

    Kick statistics are now also persistent between sessions.
    Bans are no longer printed while they're read. This happened for every master server connection.

    Always activate dependency tracking.
    Proper error handling added. Well, perhaps not proper, but the script now exits on failure.

    Phasing fix roundup.
    The way cylce walls that are considered to be important for future collisions are gridded has been revamped: They're no longer dropped as they would be after a turn, which causes a sync to the clients, but only a partial gPlayerWall referencing the first bit of the gNetPlayerWall is copied. The gNetPlayerWall is left unchanged.
    In addition, to exploit the cheaper gridding, the action is now triggered more often. Grinding an enemy wall triggers it now all the time, not just when the grind is started.
