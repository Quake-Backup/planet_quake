g_noLocalhost_errorMessage (default=...disabled)	&lt;--	The error message that a connection local client will see
g_voidProtection (default=0)				&lt;--	Variable to enable player protection from faling off maps into the void.  This is especially useful in space maps
								1 = Instaed of dying when you hit the bottom of the map, you will land and can move around.
								2 = Instead of dying when you hit the bottom of the map, you will instead be teleported back to somewhere on the map.
g_maxHealthMultiplier_noCountDown (default=0)		&lt;--	Turning this on (setting it to 1) will allow you to gain health every second equal to g_regen_addhealth.  This effective acts like you have the regeneration powerup, except that you don't have the powerup's skin or sound.
g_antiGravityBoots (default=0)				&lt;--	Boolean to turn on anti-gravity boots.  when turned on (by typing /boots in the console) the player will encounter decreased gravity.  Typing /boots again in the console will disable the boots.
g_antiGravityBoots_amount (default=2)			&lt;--	The number of anti-gravity boots each player has.  If set to zero, each player will have an infinite number of anti-gravity boots, and each anti-gravity boot will not have a time limit, so the player will be forced to type /boots twice, once to turn them on and once to turn them off.
g_antiGravityBoots_duration (default=30)		&lt;--	The length of time, in seconds, that anti-gravity boots will last.  The variable is not used if g_antiGravityBoots_amount is set to 0.
g_antiGravityBoots_percent (default=0.30)		&lt;--	The percent of normal gravity that the player will experience when using boots.  For example, when set to 0.20, the player will experience only 20% of normal gravity.
g_allowVote (default=1)					&lt;--	The number of votes each player will be able to call per map.  Each player is always restricted to voting once per callvote, and this variable controls the number of callvotes each player can call per map.
g_allowVote_frequency (default=60)			&lt;--	The number of seconds that must pass between votes being called by a player.
g_allowVote_*						&lt;--	Set of allowed commands that can be voted upon.  For instance, if you want players to be allowed use the map command, do a 'set g_allowvote_map 1' at the console or in your config.  If you want players to be allowed to mute someone, then do a 'set g_allowvote_mute 1' at the console.  Create as many g_allowvote_* variables you need for your players to callvote on anything they want, although remember that anyone can vote so beware of players trying to fool around.
g_allowVote_help (default="")				&lt;--	Text printed to the console if a person types /callvote into their console for determining what commands are available to callvote on.  This text is prefixed with "Available vote commands are: ".
g_allowVote_help_* (default="")				&lt;--	Text printed to the console if a person types /callvote {command} ? (where {command} is g_allowVote_*) into their console for determining help with commands that are available to callvote on.
g_allowvote_passingValue (default=0.5)			&lt;--	The precentage of players, plus one, that must vote yes to a vote in order for that vote to be passed.  For instance, if you have 16 people in your server and this value is set to 0.75, then 13 people must vote yes for a vote to pass.  Valid values are between 0 and 1.
g_allowvote_failonTimeout (default=1)			&lt;--	Boolean to control what happens to votes that are not passed after the 30 second timeout for votes has passed.  If set to 1, then the vote will always fail.  If set to 0, then the vote will pass or fail based on the number of people who have voted rather than the number of people in the arena.
g_ctf_returnFlag (default=0)				&lt;--	Boolean to force players to return their flags back to their own bases rather than having the flags being returned automatically.
pmove_fixed (default=0)					&lt;--	Boolean to disable framerate dependant physics.  Turning this on (1) will allow all players to jump the same distance regardless of their framerate on their client.
pmove_msec (default=8)					&lt;--	Value to control the physics calculated by the server for each player.  A value of 8 (1000 milliseconds / 8) will equal a simulated 125 frames/sec physics calculation for each player.
pmove_accurate (default=0)				&lt;--	Boolean to disable framerate dependant physics.  Turning this on (1) will allow all players to jump the same distance regardless of their framerate on their client.  This is very similar to pmove_fixed, but better at the cost of slightly more bandwidth used by players.  It is better than pmove_fixed.  If you turn pmove_accurate on, then turn pmove_fixed off.
g_teamtourney (default=0)				&lt;--	TeamTourney is a variation on normal 1v1 tournament where teams of 1 to any number can play against other team (2v2, 3v3, etc).  When a team loses, they are pushed to spectators and the spectators become the players, much like normal 1v1 works.  Wins and losses are also tracked with g_calcstats.  If g_gametype is set to TDM or CTF modes, then setting this value to something greater than 0 will represent the number of players that can be on each team.  For instance, if you set it to be 2 then you are creating a 2v2 game.
g_teamTourney_minPlayers (default=1)			&lt;--	When TeamTourney is on, this number represents the minimum number of players a team must have for the game to start.  If at any time a team's player count goes below this number then the game will go to warmup until another person joins.
g_respawnDelay (default=1700)				&lt;--	The amount of time, in millisecons, that you have to wait before you can force yourself to respawn after you die or melt.
g_gameMod_followTeamOnly (default=0)			&lt;--	Boolean to control in freezetag or lastmanstanding whether you can follow anyone or your teammates only.
g_timeout_teamReset (default=1)				&lt;--	Boolean to reset (melt or spawn) all teammates when a timeout is called.  If set to 0, teammates frozen (if g_gameMod = 2) will not be melted when a timeout is called.
g_teamForceBalance (default=0)				&lt;--	If set to greater than 0, it will for the teams to be balanced as players connect and change teams.  The value of this variable is equal to the maximum allowed spread between teams.  For instance, if you have it set to 1, players will be able to make the teams 2v3 or 3v4, bu not 2v4, since 2v4 has a spread of 2.
g_linking (default=1)					&lt;--	Boolean to prevent prediction erros from occuring between where the server says players are and where the client says they are.  Set to 1 to enable this new, more accurate behavior.
g_duplicateIPBlock (default=0)				&lt;--	Number of IP players allowed to be in the game with the same IP address.  Example: If you want to block more than 2 people from connecting to your server at once then set this to 2.  Setting this to 0 will disable this functionality.
g_floodprotect (default=1)				&lt;--	Prevents the server (and/or a bad admin or malicious player) from using the server to flood other players.
g_antiCamper_action (default=1)				&lt;--	Variable to control what happens when a player camps in a specific spot too long
								1 = Death
								2 = Teleported to random location
g_timeout_roundTimeout (default=0)			&lt;--	The amount of time, in seconds, that after a round start in freezetag or lastmanstanding that players can call a timeout.  For instance, if g_timeout_roundTime is set to 5 and the round starts at time=0, players have until time=5 to call a timeout.  After that the players have to wait until the next round to call a timeout.  Set this to 0 to allow players to call a timeout whenever they desire.
g_timeout_timeinDelay (default=3)			&lt;--	The amount of time, in seconds, that occurs between when a player signals timein and when the game starts again (when the timeout ends).
g_authenticateClient_strict (default=1)			&lt;--	Value to force all clients using the NoGhost client mod into a strict settings mode.  This forces the client to top and bottom cap certain variables that can be used to cheat or gain an unfair advantage; this will not affect normal settings, it only affects those variables that can be used to gain an unfair advantage.  Recommended on, especially if g_authenticateClient is on.
								1 = turn on strict mode
								2 = turn on strict mode in addition to stricter client side anticheat codes
g_authenticateClient_versionLimiter (default=varies)	&lt;--	Value to control the lowest build of the NoGhost client mod that players are allowed to play with.  Updates to the client mod come out periodically, and this allows a server admin to force all the players to get at least a certain build level before they play.
g_promode (default=0)					&lt;--	Boolean to enable ProMode physics and game play.  This requires more memory to run, so server operators might need to adjust their com_hunkmegs a little higher.  Note: due to the memory requirements of this mode, this variable can only be set _before_ the first map is started when the server is brought up.  In short, if you want to use this, do "set g_promode 1" at the top of your config and then start your map.
g_freezetag_chatMeltTime (default=5000)			&lt;--	The amount of time, in milliseconds, a person will auto-melt in freezetag when they are shot while chatting.  0 will disable this feature entirely.  This variable should be set higher than 200 for proper function.
g_antiCamper_ignoreChat (default=1)			&lt;--	Boolean to force the anticamper codes to ignore a person chatting since they are not camping.  Setting this to 0 will allow the anticamper codes to kill a camper
g_suddendeath_time (default=0)				&lt;--	The additional time, in minutes, the match will be extended by if time runs out while the score is tied.  The timelimit will be extended by this amount, and will override the normal sudden death behavior of "next point wins"
g_pause_teleport (default=0)				&lt;--	Boolean to control whether or not players should teleport after a server admin or ref unpauses a game 
g_knockback_type (default=15)				&lt;--	Variable to control the type of knockback players feel.  Add up the values you want to use and set g_knockback_type to it.
								1 = knockback affects alive opponents
								2 = affects alive team mates
								4 = affects dead/frozen opponents
								8 = affects dead/frozen team mates
g_timeout_pause (default=0)				&lt;--	Boolean to enable or disable player pausing while a timeout has been called.  If you keep this at 0 players can move around during a timeout.  Setting this to 1 makes players frozen during the timeout.
g_timeout_teleport (default=1)				&lt;--	Boolean to teleport everyone after a timeout is over.  Turning this off will cause a timeout to simply end.
g_freezetag_startFrozen (default=0)			&lt;--	Boolean to force all players who join a server/game mid-point in a freezetag game to wait until the point ends before spawning.  Also discourages people from reconnecting when they die.
g_duplicateIPBlock_options (default=0)			&lt;--	Variable to control how to deal with a scenario where more than one player is connecting from a single ip.
								0 = do nothing
								1 = kick the person who is currently in the server playing with the same ip
								2 = kickban the person for 5 games who is currently in the server playing with the same ip
g_consoleMessage (default=0)				&lt;--	Set this value to be how often (in seconds) you want messages to be sent to all players in the game.  Enabling this feature will take messages, line by line, from the g_consoleMessage_file and print them to each player's console every g_consoleMessage number of seconds.  This is handy for spamming your clan's website, etc.
g_consoleMessage_file (default=consolemessage.txt)	&lt;--	The file containing the messages you want to be printed on the console.  One message per line.  Create this file where you have the noghost pk3 file.
g_antiCamper_scorePenalty (default=0)			&lt;--	The amount of points a camper will lose, per second, when they are caught camping based on the g_antiCamper codes


new/improved server commands...
Note the command structure:
[] = means a required variable
{} = means an optional variable

banning				&lt;--	This functionality has been redone for more granularity and to work better with g_autoBan.  In the stock quake engine, you would add ip addresses to g_banIPs and they would be banned forever.  Now, when you ban someone, you can tell the quake engine how long you want the player banned for.  This new functionality has caused some backward compatibilities, so if you have a current list of IP addresses that you want banned forever, then make a note of them, clear the g_banips variable, then add them back in using the addip command.  Note: If you want a person banned forever, set their how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for to be -1.
		addip [player's_IP_address] [how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for]
		removeip [player's_IP_address] {how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for}
		kickban [player's_name_or_slot_number] [how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for]

banning to an external file	&lt;--	This functionality allows you to use a text file to hold a list of IP addresses that are banned.
		banfile_addip [player's_IP_address or player's_IP_prefix/network_mask] [how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for]
		banfile_removeip [player's_IP_address] {how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for}
		banfile_kickban [player's_name_or_slot_number] [how_many_games_you_want_them_banned_for]
		banfile_listip		&lt;-- lists all the ip addresses in the banfile

muting				&lt;--	This function has been added to mute certain players.  When a player disconnects or the map restarts, that client slot is automatically unmuted.
		mute [player's_name_or_slot_number]
		unmute [player's_name_or_slot_number]

telling as the console		&lt;--	This function gives the admin the ability to talk to certain players, rather than to everyone in the arena, from the console.  Acts the same as the \tell command inside the game.
		tell [player's_name_or_slot_number] [message]

pausing the game		&lt;--	This function gives the admin the ability to pause the entire game.  All players will be unable to shoot, move, or be affected by gravity.
		pause
		unpause

referees			&lt;--	This function allows the admin to delegate control of certain commands to trusted players.  The setref command is used to turn on the referee abilities and the ref command is used to issue commands to the quake server.
		setref [referee_password]
		ref [command] {command_arguments}
		ref playerlist						prints out a list of all players.
		ref hideref						hides the referee.  this command must be allowed by setting g_referee_allowedcmd_hideref to 1.
		ref unhideref						unhides the referee.  this command must be allowed by setting g_referee_allowedcmd_unhideref to 1.
		ref vote						referee voting.  A referee can force a vote to pass or fail by doing a /ref vote pass or /ref vote fail.
		ref warn [player's_name_or_slot_number] [message]	warns a player.  this command must be allowed by setting g_referee_allowedcmd_unhideref to 1.
	other ref commands, like mute, kick, or kickban for instance, need to be authorized by the server admin for use by refs.  To do this, set the appropriate variable.  For instance, to allow a ref to mute someone, set g_referee_allowedcmd_mute to 1.  Continue setting these variables until you have given your refs the appropriate commands to admin the server correctly.  All console commands and rcon commands are valid ref commands, just set the appropriate variable.

voting				&lt;--	This function allows the admin to allow only certain commands to be voted upon.
		g_allowVote_[variable name] 1
	other ref commands, like mute, kick, or kickban for instance, need to be authorized by the server admin for use by refs.  To do this, set the appropriate variable.  For instance, to allow a ref to mute someone, set g_referee_allowedcmd_mute to 1.  Continue setting these variables until you have given your refs the appropriate commands to admin the server correctly.  All console commands and rcon commands are valid ref commands, just set the appropriate variable.


forceteam			&lt;--	This function forces a player onto a team.  Abbreviations for the team variable in the command can be used, for instance to force player 2 onto the red team, use: forceteam 2 r.  You can use the letter b for the blue team and s for spectator team.
		forceteam [player's_name_or_slot number] [team]


serverstatus			&lt;--	This function dislays information about the people playing on the server, similar to using the 'status' command from the console.  This is for console or rcon use only.
		serverstatus

replacing map items		&lt;--	This function allows you to replace certain items on the map, like weapons or health.
		set replace_[item_type]_[item_name] [item_type]_[item_name]
	See the items.txt file that is in the configs directory of the NoGhost zip file.  It contains all the appropriate item names and item types required.  For instance, to replace the railgun with the rocket launcher in your arena, you'd type set replace_weapon_railgun weapon_rocketlauncher in your console..  Also for example, to replace the mega health with the quad damage, you'd type set replace_item_health_mega item_quad in your console.  Continue setting these variables until you have replaced all the items that you desire.

team locking			&lt;--	This function allows you to lock a team so that other people cannot join it
		lockteam						prints out a list of which teams are locked and unlocked
		lockteam [team]						locks a team.  [team] can be red or blue, or can be r or b.  locking the team a second time will make the lock last across map restarts or game resets.
		unlockteam [team]					unlocks a team.  [team] can be red or blue, or can r or b.  locking the team a second time will make the lock last across map restarts or game resets.

ready/unready			&lt;--	These two commands, when used with g_doReady 1 force the game to only start when all players signal they are ready.
