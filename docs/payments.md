The goal is to support multiple payment types, in multiple configurations.

That is, payments can be match based, where a player makes a small transaction in order to join a match. This is currently supported with Lightning Network and QR codes.

A future goal is to support paying for specific content, either a specific map availability, multiple hosted server, or even weapon and character content, all from within the game.

## Payment options

  * Lightning Network bitcoin transactions, see `sv_ln*` settings for more information. QR code generation by [Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library).


## TODOs

  * Payment API for micropayments to access server or content https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/payment-request-api
