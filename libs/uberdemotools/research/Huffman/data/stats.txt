These stats were gathered from a real-world demo dataset slightly bigger than 1 GB:
775254428 - Huffman symbols decoded
561954279 - Huffman symbols with code length <= 8bits
72%       - Percentage of symbols found with length <= 8 bits

It looks like the performance of "long decodes" does matter more than it should.
